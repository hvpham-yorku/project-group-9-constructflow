## Project Structure

Iteration 0: Initial Planning:

1. A vision statement: This one-page statement consists of a title, a summary sentence that
describes the overall scope of your project, and several paragraphs containing more detail
about your vision for the project. It should include a description of what the project is
(including who the users are), why the project is valuable, and the success criteria that
indicate the goal(s) of the project.

2. Big user stories: these user stories describe the main features of your software in very
broad terms, for the entire project. You should create 3-4 big stories (categories of
features) for the entire project (final release) and 5 to 6 user stories per iteration.

3. Iteration 1 detailed user stories: these are the user stories you plan to implement in the
first iteration, in greater detail. You should create 5-6 user stories for the first iteration.

4. Customer meeting’s summary video: {YOUTUBE} https://youtu.be/ytbclsm6Geg
